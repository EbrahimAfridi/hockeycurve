### Project README: Task Manager Full-Stack Application

# Task Manager Application

## Overview

This Task Manager is a full-stack web application designed to simplify task management while offering a clean, user-friendly experience. The application is built using modern technologies, including **React.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Hono.js**, **Cloudflare Workers**, **TypeScript**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Prisma ORM**.

We have implemented a highly modular code structure that emphasizes **separation of concerns**, **type safety**, and **best coding practices**. The result is a fast, reliable, and secure application that delivers a smooth user experience.

## Features

- **Task Creation & Management**: Create, update, delete, and manage tasks efficiently.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The app provides a seamless experience, updating task data dynamically without page reloads.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS, the UI is fully responsive and optimized for all devices.
- **Type Safety**: Leveraging TypeScript, the app ensures better development practices with strong typing and avoiding the `any` type for precise code integrity.
- **REST API**: The backend, developed with Hono.js and running on Cloudflare Workers, offers fast and secure endpoints.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: A reliable and scalable database with Prisma ORM ensures smooth data management and queries.
- **Modular Architecture**: Each part of the application is separated by concern, making the codebase easy to understand, maintain, and scale.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Hono.js, Cloudflare Workers
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
